To make it work for PyTorch, we need to first convert the `pandas.DataFrame` object to a `torch.Tensor` object with the `torch.float32` data type (because our PyTorch model will take this data type as the input). The PyTorch tensor object is similar to `numpy.array` but with more functions to support GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) computing. GPU can perform matrix operations much more efficiently than CPU (Central Processing Unit), and people usually use PyTorch to benefit from its powerful GPU computing support.
